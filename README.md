# Radio
This is a P2P social media called radio, based on IPV6 technology.
It’s called radio since every user will have his own ”station” to send files, by
using a randomly generated multicast channel. People who follow the user will actually be listening to his own multicast channel address.
If someone is not present during a period that someone he follows posts something, when entering the network, the algorithm will connect to peers to send back what happened in the network, therefore the user only share files sent by people he follow.

To handle 51% attack, the algorithm when receiving files from peers will decide based on the score of the peers (estimate of probability of sending the correct file), which file is more probable to be the correct one. The formula and the proof of it is contained in the "doc.pdf" file

Every message is sent together with a key and hash. The key will be used to confirm that the message was sent by this particular user, since every user in the network store the hash of the key, and the hash sent will replace the hash that every user currently have. Passwords are generated by the algorithm, not the users.

To avoid users creating an infinity of users on the network, when connecting for the first time, the user will need to send a proof of work together to become a member of the network.
